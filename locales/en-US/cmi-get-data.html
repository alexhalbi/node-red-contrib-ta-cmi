        <dl class="message-properties">
            <dt>Description</dt>
            <dd>Use a name that clearly describes the C.M.I. You need every C.M.I. to be created here <b>only once</b>. This means that normally it is sufficient to create a single configuration.</dd>
            
            <dt>IP-Address</dt>
            <dd>You can also use the host name instead of the IP address. If you are using the IP address, it is recommended to use a fixed / static IP address. </dd>

            <dt>Username</dt>
            <dd>Use the account that you entered in the C.M.I. as the username in 'Settings' - 'Passwords' - 'Expert'. <b>You must use the data from the 'Expert' account.</b> The user or guest account does not work. Please note this is case sensitive!</dd>

            <dt>Password</dt>
            <dd>Enter the password for the corresponding user.</dd>

            <dt>CAN Node</dt>
            <dd>Enter the CAN node number of the device that is to be queried via the C.M.I. This is usually the node number of the controller from which the data is to be obtained.</dd>

            <dt>Interval</dt>
            <dd>This polling interval defines how long the node will wait between two polls of the C.M.I.
            <dd><em>The minimum is one minute and is determined by Technische Alternative RT GmbH. This is not a restriction by the node.</em></dd>
